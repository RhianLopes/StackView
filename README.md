# :tent: Stack View

This app is to study and understand the stack view and how to use in applications, here we have a simple example with a three stack views, two horizontal stack view with two views inside and a external vertical stack view with the another two stack views inside, with some constraints to centralize these on IPhone screens.

This app was built with the [IOS 12 Development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-desenvolvimento-ios/), at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), by instructor [Jamilton Damasceno](https://www.udemy.com/user/jamiltondamasceno/). This is my first IOS app and my first contact with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), I hope you like it ðŸ™‚.
